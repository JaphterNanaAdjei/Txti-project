    <h1>Txti is shutting down.</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>Due to bad actors, txti will be shutting down 
            permanently on July 1, 2023.</strong> Until that <br> time,
             no new pages can be created. Please save any content
              you need and find another <br> place for your content.
    </p>
    <p>
        Txti was created nine years ago with a simple and benevolant
         mission: to play a part in a <br> more globally accessible
          internet. Since then, the whole world has changed. Now,
           there is <br> less need for web pages that work on flip phones,
            and more need for trustworthiness and <br> safety on the
             internet. As txti is not able to keep up with this need,
              it's time for it to step <br> aside to ensure we're not 
              causing harm.
    </p>

        Thank you to everyone who used and loved txti. It was a fun
         and useful project that I <br> simply wasn't able to maintain.
          There are many lessons learned here, but I'm grateful to <br>
           have been a part of a special era of the internet's
            evolution.
